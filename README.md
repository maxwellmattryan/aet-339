# AET 339 - Generative Audio Programming

## About 

Students will acquire procedural audio skills using SuperCollider as a tool for real-time, generative audio production. Additionally, students will learn how to integrate such generative processes with other media (live digital visualization, etc.) and will explore methods of textural generation and sound design using SuperCollider.
